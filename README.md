# ðŸŽ“ Computer Vision & Image Processing - Assignment_01: 

## Course Assignment â€“ Image Processing

This repository contains Python implementations for basic image processing tasks using OpenCV and NumPy. The assignment includes four operations involving grayscale image transformation, spatial filtering, geometric rotation, and resolution reduction.

## âœ… Task List

### ðŸ”¢ Task 1: Intensity Level Reduction
Reduce the number of gray levels in an image from 256 to a lower number that is a power of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, ..., 256).  

---

### ðŸ§® Task 2: Spatial Averaging (Mean Filter)
Apply spatial averaging using mean filters with 3Ã—3, 10Ã—10, and 20Ã—20 kernels.  

---

### ðŸ”„ Task 3: Image Rotation
Rotate the image by 45Â° and 90Â° using affine transformation.  

---

### ðŸ“‰ Task 4: Spatial Resolution Reduction (Block Averaging)
Reduce spatial resolution by dividing the image into non-overlapping blocks (3Ã—3, 5Ã—5, 7Ã—7) and replacing each block with its average.
